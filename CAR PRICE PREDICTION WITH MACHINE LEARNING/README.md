### ******Project Summary******: Car Price Prediction

### **Goal**: 
To predict the selling price of used cars using the `car data.csv` dataset.

### ******Process******:
I prepared the data by converting text columns (like Fuel Type) into numbers. Then, I trained a Random Forest model to learn from the data and predict the prices.

### **Result**: 
The model was very accurate and achieved an R-squared score of 0.96. This was a great project for learning how to handle a dataset with both text and numbers.
