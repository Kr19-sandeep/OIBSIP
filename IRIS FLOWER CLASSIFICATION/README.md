###### **Project Summary: Iris Flower Classification**

###### **Goal**
To classify Iris flowers into one of three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) using the `Iris.csv` dataset.

###### **Process**
I prepared the flower measurement data, trained a classification model to learn the patterns for each species, and then tested the model's predictions.

###### **Result**
The model was perfect, achieving **100% accuracy**. This was an excellent first project for understanding how classification works.
