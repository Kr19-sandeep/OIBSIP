Project Summary: Iris Flower Classification

Goal: To classify Iris flowers into one of three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) using the `Iris.csv` dataset.

Process: I prepared the flower measurement data, trained a classification model to learn the patterns for each species, and then tested the model's predictions.

Result: The model was perfect, achieving 100% accuracy. This was an excellent first project for understanding how classification works.
