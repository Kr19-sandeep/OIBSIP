# Project 1: Iris Flower Classification

This project is a classic introduction to machine learning classification. The goal is to build a model that can classify Iris flowers into one of three species.

* **Dataset:** `Iris.csv`
* **Model Used:** A simple classification model (like Logistic Regression).
* **Result:** The model achieved a perfect accuracy of **100%**.

### How to Use
The complete code is in the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in this folder. You can open and run it using Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
