**Project Report: Advertising & Sales Project**

1. **My Goal**

My main goal for this project was to see if I could predict product sales. I wanted to use the money spent on different ads (like TV, Radio, and Newspaper) to guess how high the sales would be.

2.**The Data I Used**

I used the `Advertising.csv` file for this. It was a simple dataset with columns for the money spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads, and the final `Sales` column, which I had to predict.

3. **Final Thoughts**

This was a fun project. I learned how to build a model to predict numbers and saw that TV and Radio ads seem to be very important for sales. The Linear Regression model was a good choice for this task.
