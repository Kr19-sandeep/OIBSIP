Project Report: Advertising & Sales Project

1. My Goal

My main goal for this project was to see if I could predict product sales. I wanted to use the money spent on different ads (like TV, Radio, and Newspaper) to guess how high the sales would be.

2. The Data I Used

I used the `Advertising.csv` file for this. It was a simple dataset with columns for the money spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads, and the final `Sales` column, which I had to predict.

3. What I Did (My Steps)

1.  First, I loaded the data and removed an extra column that wasn't needed.
2.  I made a few scatter plots to see how spending on TV and Radio ads affected sales.
3.  Then, I split my data into a training part (to teach the model) and a testing part (to check the model).
4.  I used a Linear Regression model because I wanted to find the connection between spending and sales.
5.  Finally, I used the trained model to make predictions on my test data.


4. The Result

My model worked really well! It got an R-squared score of 0.90

This basically means that the ad spending data can explain about 90% of why the sales went up or down. I was very happy with this result.

5. Final Thoughts

This was a fun project. I learned how to build a model to predict numbers and saw that TV and Radio ads seem to be very important for sales. The Linear Regression model was a good choice for this task.
