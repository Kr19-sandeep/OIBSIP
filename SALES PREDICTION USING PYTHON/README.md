Project Report: Advertising & Sales Project

1. My Goal

My main goal for this project was to see if I could predict product sales. I wanted to use the money spent on different ads (like TV, Radio, and Newspaper) to guess how high the sales would be.

2. The Data I Used

I used the `Advertising.csv` file for this. It was a simple dataset with columns for the money spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads, and the final `Sales` column, which I had to predict.

3. What I Did (My Steps)

1.  Prepared and Explored the Data: First, I loaded the data, cleaned up an extra column, and then made a few plots to see how ad spending was related to sales.
2.  Built the Model: I split the data into training and testing sets and then trained a Linear Regression model on the training data.
3.  Checked the Results: Finally, I used the trained model to make predictions on the test data and checked its accuracy.

4. The Result

My model worked really well! It got an R-squared score of 0.90.
This basically means that the ad spending data can explain about 90% of why the sales went up or down. I was very happy with this result.


5. Final Thoughts
This was a fun project. I learned how to build a model to predict numbers and saw that TV and Radio ads seem to be very important for sales. The Linear Regression model was a good choice for this task.
